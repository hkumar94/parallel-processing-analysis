# parallel-processing-analysis
Serial processing of machine learning algorithms or some its steps takes a lot of time as those steps are running sequentially. Implementing parallel processing helps the machine learning algorithms to get results in a fast and clean manner. Identifying steps that are not dependent on each other and running them parallel on systems or cores is the first step towards parallelization in machine learning. The question arises, which machine-learning algorithm or their pre-processing steps can be parallelized to optimize the overall implementation. This project identifies and compares different parallelized approaches in machine learning and reviews how much it affects the overall performance.
